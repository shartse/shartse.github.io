This is a simple, statically generated personal website made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on Github Pages.
I mostly followed [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

## Test Changes Locally

Requires `ruby`, `jekyll` and `bundler`. 

```
> `bundle install`
> `bundle exec jekyll serve`
```

## Deploy

The site will be redeployed each time the `master` branch is updated.
