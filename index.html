<p>
Iâ€™m a software engineer. Previously, I worked at Fastly on HTTP caching semantics and storage. Before that,
I worked at Delphix, where I worked on ZFS as well as a host of other OS related things.

I love exploring complicated systems - especially distributed systems, operating systems, programming languages and software security.
I also love art and making things generally.
