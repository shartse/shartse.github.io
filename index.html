I’m a software engineer at Delphix, where I work on ZFS as well as a host of
other OS related things.

<p>
I love exploring operating systems, programming languages and software security. 
I also have a passion for technical communication which I’ve grown 
through speaking at OpenSource software conferences and writing blog posts.
