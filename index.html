<p>
Iâ€™m a software engineer at <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>.

In Spring 2023 I participated in the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">The Recurse Center</a>. Previously, I worked at Fastly on HTTP caching semantics and storage. Before that,
I worked at Delphix, where I worked on the ZFS filesystem.
</p>

<p>
In general, I love exploring and figuring out how to improve complicated people and software systems. I've especially enjoyed working on
distributed systems, operating systems and programming languages.
</p>

<p>
I also love art and making things generally.
Here are some of the things I've been doing/making:
