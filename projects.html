    <h3>Internship at Microsoft</h3>
    <p>
    This summer I've been working in Microsoft's Operating Systems Group on a pre-checkin validation system. The team I'm on is working on a change validation system that's been around awhile and we're facing the challenges of working in a legacy codebase. 
    <p>

    <h3>Programming Language Semantics: Netlogo</h3>
    As my final project in Brown's CS273 I wrote a <a href="netlogo_semantics.pdf">paper</a> outlining a formal semantics of the agent-based modeling and teaching language Netlogo. I also discussed Logo in general and the theory behind it as an educational tool.

  <h3><a href ="http://www.simtable.com/">Simtable</a></h3>
  <p>
   I've been doing development for the Santa Fe based Simtable company. My main project was a web app which allows you to physically interact with your Agent-based simuations. I worked with Javascript, AgentScipt, and fiducial codes to build ABMs that users can project on a table and then program with objects around them.

  <h3>Los Alamos National Labs</h3>
 <p>
I worked on a team improving computation methods for large scale
physical simulations based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement methods. We found that by changing
the underlying data structure from a kd-tree to a hash table, numerous, simple cell operations
could be significantly sped-up and run on the GPU. We had a <a href="http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/13093371X">paper</a> published in SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing.

  <h3><a href ="http://micro-events.appspot.com/">Hack@Brown</a></h3>
  <p>
   A group of friends and I wrote a web app that makes use of Instram and Whispr APIs to show a heat map instagram photo spots plus a few popular and/or random posts.
