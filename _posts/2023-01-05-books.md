This is a fairly abstract list of my favorite books that I read last year.

- [The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119073.The_Name_of_the_Rose) - Medieval monk is literally Sherlock Holmes.

- [Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead, Olgo Tokarczuk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51648276-drive-your-plow-over-the-bones-of-the-dead) - Beautifully written and often surreal; becoming
invisible with age and caring about things just so much.

- [Excellent Women, Barbara Pym](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178565.Excellent_Womenv) - Just like, being a person.

- [All Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries, #1), Martha Wells](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red) - A security cyborg figuring out if it wants to be a person. It's a well-plotted, fast-paced novella. The whole series is amazing. 

- [Either/Or, Elif Batuman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58890783-either-or) - Trying to figure out some strategies for being a person.

- [The Night Watchman, Louise Erdrich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43721059-the-night-watchman) - Historical fiction following several characters, exploring Native dispossession and identity in the 1950s. 

- [I'm Glad My Mom Died, Jennette McCurdy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59364173-i-m-glad-my-mom-died) - Memoir - incredibly disturbing, readable, self-aware and generous. 

- [True Biz, Sara Novic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58395049-true-biz) - Multi-perspective fictional narrative mixed in with lessons about ASL, disability rights activism and Deaf culture.
